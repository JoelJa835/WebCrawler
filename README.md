# WebCrawler
Crawl 1K websites and interact with each webpage for a couple of seconds (e.g., click elements, scroll, etc.) using i) a Breadth-first and ii) a depth-first traversal and identify which web pages have a login option.We are using the Tranco list to gather your dataset and use a headless-browser (e.g., phantomjs) for interacting with each webpage.
